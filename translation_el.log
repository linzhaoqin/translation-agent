</TRANSLATION>

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying Greek grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and take into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms Greek).

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation.
Output only the suggestions and nothing else.

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying Greek grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and take into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms Greek).

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation.
Output only the suggestions and nothing else.

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying Greek grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),

(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and take into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms Greek).

</TRANSLATION>

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. "Πρωτοποριακή Αναγνώριση Κειμένου OCR" would sound more natural in Greek as "Πρωτοποριακή Οπτική Αναγνώριση Χαρακτήρων (OCR)" - this provides better context for Greek readers.

2. "Βήμα 2: Μεταφράστε το Κείμενο της Εικόνας στη Γλώσσα σας" could be simplified to "Βήμα 2: Μετάφραση του Κειμένου στη Γλώσσα σας" to match the concise style of the source text.

3. "Εις βάθος πληροφορίες" is too formal for the context; "Λεπτομερείς πληροφορίες" would better match the casual tone of the source text.

4. "Μονάδες" for "Credits" could be better translated as "Πόντοι" which is more commonly used in Greek for digital currency/points systems.

5. "Χαίρομαι που σας γνωρίζω" is too formal for "Nice to meet you" - "Χάρηκα" would be more natural and casual in Greek.

6. "Πρόσθετα Χαρακτηριστικά" appears twice in the translation - for consistency, one instance should be "Επιπλέον Λειτουργίες" to avoid repetition.

7. "Αιτήματα για νέα χαρακτηριστικά" could be more naturally expressed as "Δυνατότητα αίτησης νέων λειτουργιών".

8. The phrase "μετάφραση" in translateBtnLoadingState should be "μεταφράζεται" to better indicate the ongoing action.

9. "Παρακαλώ περιμένετε" could be more casual as "Περιμένετε λίγο" to match the friendly tone of "Please wait".

10. "Εξερευνήστε τις ισχυρές περιπτώσεις χρήσης μας" sounds too literal - "Δείτε πώς μπορείτε να αξιοποιήσετε την εφαρμογή" would be more natural in Greek.

11. The translation of "translating" as "μετάφραση" should be "γίνεται μετάφραση" to better indicate the process state.

12. "Πληρώστε μόνο για ό,τι χρησιμοποιείτε" could be more idiomatic as "Πληρώνετε μόνο αυτά που χρησιμοποιείτε".
</EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

Taking into account the expert suggestions rewrite the translation to improve it, paying attention
to whether there are ways to improve the translation's

(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying Greek grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
(iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
(v) other errors.

Output only the new translation of the indicated part and nothing else.

</TRANSLATION>

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. "Γλώσσα-στόχος" would sound more natural in Greek as "Γλώσσα προορισμού" - the hyphenated form is uncommon in Greek.

2. "Πληροφορίες Υποβάθρου" could be better translated as "Πλαισίωση" or "Πλαίσιο αναφοράς" which better captures the meaning of "Background Info" in this context.

3. "Αριθμός Παραγγελίας" should be "Κωδικός Παραγγελίας" as this better reflects the technical meaning of "Order ID".

4. "Αναρτήσεις Ιστολογίου" sounds formal - "Άρθρα Blog" is more commonly used in modern Greek websites.

5. The translation of "Μπενγκάλι" for Bengali should be "Βεγγαλικά" which is the standard Greek term.

6. "Φιλιππινέζικα" should be "Φιλιππινικά" which is the more formal and correct term for the language.

7. In the FAQ section, "εξαιρετικά ακριβείς" could be simplified to "πολύ ακριβείς" to sound more natural in Greek.

8. The phrase "επιδεικνύοντας ακριβή ανίχνευση" in the alt text could be more naturally expressed as "παρουσιάζοντας την ακριβή αναγνώριση".

9. "χρυσομάτης λυθρίνι" should include parentheses for clarity: "χρυσομάτης (λυθρίνι)".

10. The translation maintains English currency symbols ($) - these should be localized with the Euro symbol (€) for the Greek market.

11. The phrase "Επιστρέψτε στην Αρχική" would be more idiomatic as "Επιστροφή στην κεντρική σελίδα".

12. "Σουαχίλι" should be "Σουαχίλι" - no need for capitalization as it's a language name in Greek.
</EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

Taking into account the expert suggestions rewrite the translation to improve it, paying attention
to whether there are ways to improve the translation's

(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying Greek grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
(iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
(v) other errors.

Output only the new translation of the indicated part and nothing else.

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. In the French letter translation, "Sincèrement" was left untranslated in the background info. It should be translated as "Με ειλικρίνεια" to maintain consistency.

2. In the Spanish note's background info, consider replacing "αστείος" with "χιουμοριστικός" which is more natural in Greek when describing someone's personality.

3. The translation of "handwritten" in "Spanish Handwritten Note" as "Χειρόγραφο" could be better as "Χειρόγραφη Σημείωση" to match Greek gender agreement.

4. In the Finnish letter translation, "Xoxo" was translated as "Φιλιά και αγκαλιές" which is accurate but could be more colloquial as "Φιλάκια κ αγκαλίτσες" to match the informal tone.

5. For consistency, consider translating all English names (like "Tarbox") into their Greek equivalents where they exist.

6. In the Russian instructions, "Store" was translated as "Αποθηκεύστε" which could be more specific as "Φυλάξτε σε δροσερό μέρος" to match typical Greek product instructions.

7. The translation of "laid-back" as "χαλαρός" in the Spanish note could be enhanced to "άνετος" which better captures the intended meaning in this context.

8. In the Japanese translation comparison, consider replacing "σταθερό πνεύμα" with "ακλόνητο πνεύμα" which better conveys the strength of conviction in the original.

9. The phrase "λιγότερο αγαπημένο της τράπεζάς σου" in the Finnish letter translation is too literal and unclear - consider rephrasing for better clarity in Greek.

10. For technical consistency, consider using an em dash (—) instead of a hyphen (-) in Greek text where appropriate, particularly in the Japanese translation comparison.
</EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

Taking into account the expert suggestions rewrite the translation to improve it, paying attention
to whether there are ways to improve the translation's

(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying Greek grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
(iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
(v) other errors.
