</TRANSLATION>

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying korean grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and take into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms korean).

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation.
Output only the suggestions and nothing else.

</TRANSLATION>

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying korean grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and take into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms korean).

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation.
Output only the suggestions and nothing else.

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying korean grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and take into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms korean).

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation.
Output only the suggestions and nothing else.

</TRANSLATION>

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. "포토레이트" (Photolate) - Consider using "포토레이트" with a hyphen ("포토-레이트") to make it easier to read and pronounce in Korean.

2. "문화적 맥락을 설명하는 유일한 AI 이미지 번역기" - Consider adding "세계" before "유일한" to emphasize its uniqueness globally, making it "세계 유일의 문화적 맥락을 설명하는 AI 이미지 번역기"

3. "구독 없음 • 사용한 만큼 지불" - The bullet point (•) could be replaced with a more commonly used Korean separator (·), making it "구독 없음 · 사용한 만큼 지불"

4. "최첨단 OCR 텍스트 인식" - Add "기술" after OCR for better clarity in Korean: "최첨단 OCR 기술로 텍스트 인식"

5. "OpenAI GPT-4o의 우수한 번역" - Consider adding "기술" after "번역" for better formality: "OpenAI GPT-4o의 우수한 번역 기술"

6. "단순 단어가 아닌 맥락을 이해" - Restructure to sound more natural in Korean: "단순한 단어 번역을 넘어선 맥락 이해"

7. "100개 이상..." - The ellipsis (...) should be replaced with Korean-style ellipsis (…)

8. "크레딧이 소진되었습니다." - Add a space before "소진" for better readability: "크레딧이 모두 소진되었습니다."

9. "이미지 처리 중" - Add "입니다" for politeness: "이미지 처리 중입니다"

10. "최고의 거래. 10% 할인" - Connect these phrases better in Korean: "최고의 거래: 10% 할인"

11. "자동 감지" - Consider using "자동 인식" which is more commonly used in Korean UI

12. "번역 중" - Add "입니다" for consistency with other loading states: "번역 중입니다"

13. "잠시만요" - For formal consistency, use "잠시만 기다려주세요" throughout instead of the casual "잠시만요"

14. "카쿄인 노리아키" - Add appropriate Japanese name particles: "카쿄인 노리아키는"

15. "강력한 활용 사례 살펴보기" - Add "를" for better grammar: "강력한 활용 사례를 살펴보기"
</EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

Taking into account the expert suggestions rewrite the translation to improve it, paying attention
to whether there are ways to improve the translation's

(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying korean grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
(iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
(v) other errors.

Output only the new translation of the indicated part and nothing else.

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. "결제가 취소되었습니다. 홈으로 돌아가서 다시 시도해 주세요." 문장에서 "홈으로 돌아가서"는 어색합니다. "메인 화면으로 돌아가서"가 더 자연스럽습니다.

2. "포토레이트: 문화적 맥락을 설명하는 유일한 AI 사진 번역기"에서 "문화적 맥락"은 "문화 배경"으로 바꾸면 더 일상적인 표현이 됩니다.

3. "피드백 감사합니다. 개선하도록 하겠습니다!"는 너무 직역된 느낌입니다. "소중한 의견 감사합니다. 더 나은 서비스로 보답하겠습니다!"가 더 자연스럽습니다.

4. "도움이 되어 기쁩니다!"는 약간 딱딱합니다. "도움이 되었다니 다행이네요!"로 하면 더 친근한 느낌이 됩니다.

5. "대상 언어"는 기술적인 느낌이 강합니다. "번역할 언어"로 바꾸면 더 이해하기 쉽습니다.

6. "복사됨!"은 너무 기계적입니다. "복사 완료!"가 더 자연스럽습니다.

7. FAQ 섹션의 답변들이 너무 형식적입니다. 좀 더 구어체로 바꾸면 좋겠습니다. 예: "~있습니다" → "~있어요"

8. "홈으로 돌아가기" 대신 "처음으로"가 더 간단하고 자주 사용되는 표현입니다.

9. 언어 이름들에서 "~어"를 일관되게 사용하지 않은 부분이 있습니다. 예를 들어 "스와힐리어"처럼 모든 언어에 "~어"를 붙이는 것이 좋습니다.

10. "사진 분석 중 오류가 발생했습니다"는 너무 딱딱합니다. "사진을 분석하는 중에 문제가 생겼어요"가 더 부드럽고 친근합니다.
</EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

(ii) fluency (by applying korean grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
(iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
(v) other errors.

Output only the new translation of the indicated part and nothing else.

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. "친애하는" 대신 "사랑하는"을 사용하면 더 자연스러운 한국어 표현이 될 것입니다.

2. "저와 함께 프랑스어를 공부해주셔서"에서 존댓말을 사용했는데, 교사가 학생에게 쓰는 편지이므로 "나와 함께 프랑스어를 공부해줘서"로 수정하는 것이 더 적절합니다.

3. "진심을 담아"는 직역체이므로, 한국어 편지에서 더 자주 사용되는 "늘 건강하길 바라며" 또는 "항상 응원하며"로 수정하면 좋겠습니다.

4. "장난기 많은 편이지만"은 "농담을 잘 하는 편이지만"으로 수정하면 더 자연스러운 한국어 표현이 됩니다.

5. "바람에게 키스를"은 직역체이므로, 한국어에서 더 자연스러운 "바람처럼 사랑을 보내며"로 수정하면 좋겠습니다.

6. "내 저울에 폭풍이 몰아치고 있다"는 너무 직역체이므로, "체중계가 폭풍을 만나버렸다"와 같이 더 자연스러운 한국어 표현으로 수정하면 좋겠습니다.

7. "윤곽선"이라는 전문 용어는 "아웃라인"이나 "테두리"로 수정하면 일반 사용자가 더 이해하기 쉬울 것입니다.

8. "기계적 작용"은 너무 전문적인 표현이므로 "세게 비틀거나 짜지 말고"와 같이 더 일상적인 표현으로 수정하면 좋겠습니다.

9. "수단이 있는 자의 책임"은 어색한 표현이므로 "능력이 있는 자의 책임"으로 수정하면 더 자연스러울 것입니다.

10. "더 이상 번역으로 헤매지 마세요!"는 "이제 언어 때문에 고생하지 마세요!"로 수정하면 더 자연스러운 한국어 광고 문구가 될 것입니다.

The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, are as follows:
<EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
1. "이동 중에도" feels slightly stiff - "언제 어디서나" would sound more natural and colloquial while conveying the same meaning of "on the go"

2. For "Break language barriers", "허물어보세요" could be changed to "극복하세요" which is more commonly used when talking about overcoming barriers in Korean business context

3. In the education section, "언어의 제약 없이" could be improved to "언어 장벽 없이" to maintain consistency with the terminology used in the business section

4. For social media section, "전 세계의 트렌드와 대화에 손쉽게 참여하세요" could be simplified to "세계적인 트렌드와 쉽게 소통하세요" which sounds more natural in Korean

5. "밈" (meme) could be written as "밈(meme)" since the term might not be familiar to all Korean users

6. In the social media description, consider changing "게시물의" to "SNS의" which is more commonly used in Korean

7. The phrase "스크린샷이나 만화 이미지도" could be more naturally expressed as "스크린샷부터 만화까지" to better flow in Korean

8. Consider adding the particle "을" after "제품 라벨" for better grammatical flow: "명함, 계약서, 제품 라벨을"
</EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

Taking into account the expert suggestions rewrite the translation to improve it, paying attention
to whether there are ways to improve the translation's

(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying korean grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
(iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
(v) other errors.

Output only the new translation of the indicated part and nothing else.

          "수성 아크릴 분산액으로 만든 장식용 테두리는 면직물과 실크 원단에 그림을 그릴 때 입체적인 디자인을 만들고 물감이 섞이는 것을 방지합니다. 세탁하고 다림질한 원단에 테두리를 그리고 3시간 동안 말리세요. 그 다음 천용 물감을 칠하세요. 테두리는 완성된 그림을 장식하는 데도 사용할 수 있습니다. 그림을 24시간 동안 말리세요. 면직물에 알맞은 온도로 스팀 없이 5분간 다림질하되, 면직물을 덮어서 하세요. 다림질 48시간 후에는 30°C에서 40°C 사이의 물로 중성세제를 사용해 세탁할 수 있으나, 세게 비틀거나 짜지 마세요. 노즐은 물로 씻어 보관하세요.",
