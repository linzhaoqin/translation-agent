# Lost in Translation? Your Guide to Converting Images to English

Need to translate text from images? Or looking to translate pictures online?

We've all been there - staring at pictures with unfamiliar text.
Time to understand what they mean.

From Japanese menus to Chinese tattoos. From Korean street signs to Arabic calligraphy. We all face these moments when traveling or browsing online.

- Example: 'Akajin miibai'
- Other apps just keep these words
- We tell you: "It's a red grouper fish!"

Only Photolate gives you this deep understanding.
