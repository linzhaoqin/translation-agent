# TL;DR



# The difficult about chinese tattoos

Chinese characters is one of the popular elements in tattoo design, because it looks beautiful and meaningful, convey a sense of mistery and deep sense of wise.

But many people don't understand the real meaning of the tattoo, even the artist themself.

That's because chinese character is context ware and embed lots of cultral infomation.
