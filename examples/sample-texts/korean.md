# Why You Need a Translation App

South Korea is a top tourist destination in Asia. It perfectly blends traditional culture with modern life.

Many Koreans speak basic English in big cities. But reading Korean text on signs and menus remains challenging. A good translation app can make your trip much easier.

We tested the most popular translation apps in real situations. This guide will help you pick the right one for your Korean trip.

# What Makes Our Test Different?

Most app comparisons just list features and specifications. We took a different approach.

We tested these apps in three common scenarios you'll face in Korea:

- Beverage labels in convenience stores
- Street art and signs
- Restaurant menus on the wall

Below are the actual test images we used:

<br>

| Korean Beverage | Street Art | Restaurant Menu |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| ![Busan Saengtak bottle, a 750ml Korean alcoholic beverage combining soju and makgeolli characteristics with green label](/images/articles/korean/korean_drink.webp) | ![Pink heart-shaped street art sign with Korean text reading 'Well done, you did great today' in cute dialect style, decorated with small blue hearts](/images/articles/korean/korean_street_sign.webp) | ![Traditional Korean restaurant menu board written in chalk, showing prices for pork belly sets, LA galbi, and side dishes with prices in Korean won](/images/articles/korean/korean_menu.webp) |

# Apps We Tested

Here are the 4 translation apps in our test:

🏆 **<a href="https://translate.google.com" target="_blank">Google Translate</a>**

The most widely used translation app worldwide. We used it as our baseline for comparison.

⚡ **<LocalLink to="/" target="_blank">Photolate</LocalLink>**

The only translation app that provides cultural context alongside translations. This unique feature helps users understand not just what things mean, but why they matter.

🌟 **<a href="https://papago.naver.com/" target="_blank">Papago</a>**

Created by Korean tech giant Naver, this app is popular among Korea travelers.

🌟 **<a href="https://translate.yandex.com" target="_blank">Yandex Translate</a>**

A free translation service from Russia's leading search engine company.

Now, let's see how each app performs in our real-world tests.

# Korean Beverage Test

Let's start with a common challenge: translating a Korean beverage label.

![Busan Saengtak bottle, a 750ml Korean alcoholic beverage combining soju and makgeolli characteristics with green label](/images/articles/korean/korean_drink.webp)

Here's how each app performed:

<br>

| Google Translate | Photolate | Yandex Translate | Papago |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| ![Google Lens translation showing Korean beverage label with text 'busan', 'Raw makgeolli', and incorrectly translated 'raw fish' on green bottle label against blurred restaurant background](/images/articles/korean/google_korean_drink.webp) | ![Photolate interface displaying Korean text detection boxes on green bottle label, showing translations 'Busan', 'Status', 'Raw Makgeolli' with detailed cultural background information about traditional Korean rice wine](/images/articles/korean/photo-translate_korean_drink.webp) | ![Yandex Translate app showing Korean beverage bottle with green label, displaying text 'Busan' and hashtag about yeast and lactic acid bacteria, with 6% alcohol content and 750ml volume information](/images/articles/korean/yandex_korean_drink.webp) | ![Papago translation interface showing Korean beverage bottle with green label translated as 'Busan fresh makgeolli', including text about homo and lactobacilli on live membrane, 6% alcohol content and 750ml volume](/images/articles/korean/papago_korean_drink.webp) |

**Translation Results**

<br>

| Text on Bottle        | Google Translate | Photolate     | Yandex Translate | Papago          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 부산 (Top Left)       | busan            | Busan         | busan            | Busan           |
| 生 막랄리 (Top Right) | Raw Makgeolli    | Raw Makgeolli | /                | fresh makgeolli |
| 생탁 (Main Text)      | raw fish         | Status        | /                | saint           |

**Analysis**

This test revealed some interesting challenges. The bottle's curved surface made text recognition difficult for all apps:

- "부산" (Busan): All apps correctly identified this major Korean city
- "生 막랄리" (Raw Makgeolli): Most apps translated this correctly, except Yandex
- "생탁" (Saengtak): None of the apps translated this correctly. It's a modern Korean alcoholic beverage combining beer and traditional rice wine characteristics

**Standout Feature**

Only Photolate provided cultural context, explaining that Makgeolli is a traditional Korean rice wine with a milky, off-white color and sweet, tangy flavor.

This additional information helps users understand not just the translation, but the product itself.

**Winner**

While most apps struggled with the curved text, Photolate stood out by providing accurate translations plus valuable cultural context.

# Korean Street Sign: Testing Artistic Text

Korean streets are full of inspirational messages. Here's a typical example:

![Pink heart-shaped street art sign with Korean text written in white, decorated with small blue hearts scattered around it on dark pavement. The sign appears to be a motivational message painted on the ground.](/images/articles/korean/korean_street_sign.webp)

This decorative message says "It's okay, you did well today." Let's see how each app handles artistic text:

<br>

| Google Translate | Photolate | Yandex Translate | Papago |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| ![Google Lens interface showing Korean text translated to English as 'are you okay' and 'You did well today' overlaid on a pink heart street art sign](/images/articles/korean/google_korean_street_sign.webp) | ![Photolate app interface showing Korean text translation with detected text boxes, English translation reading 'It's okay, You've done well today' and cultural context explanation below](/images/articles/korean/photo-translate_korean_street_sign.webp) | ![Yandex Translate app showing error message 'Could not recognize text in image' with sad emoji icon overlaid on pink heart street art sign](/images/articles/korean/yandex_korean_street_sign.webp) | ![Papago translation interface displaying Korean text translated as 'it's cold' and 'You did a great job today' with translation controls at bottom of screen](/images/articles/korean/papago_korean_street_sign.webp) |

**Translation Results:**

Photolate (Best Overall)

- Perfect translation: "It's okay, You've done well today"
- Accurately detected both Korean phrases: "괜찮아요" and "오늘 잘해왔잖아요"
- Added bonus: Explained the cultural context of this common Korean encouragement

Google Translate (Runner-up)

- Good attempt: "are you okay, You did well today"
- Minor issue: Changed the comforting statement into a question

Papago (Mixed Results)

- Partial success: "it's cold, You did a great job today"
- Problem: Mistranslated the first phrase completely

Yandex Translate (Failed)

- Unable to recognize any text
- No translation provided

**Key Finding**

Artistic text poses a major challenge for translation apps. Success depends on both text recognition (OCR) accuracy and understanding context.

Photolate excelled in both areas, while other apps struggled with at least one aspect.

# Korean Menu Test: The Ultimate Challenge

Previous tests dealt with simple text. Now let's tackle a more complex challenge: a typical Korean restaurant menu board.

These handwritten menu boards are common in local Korean restaurants. With dense text and no pictures, they often leave tourists puzzled about what to order.

![Traditional Korean restaurant menu board written in chalk, showing prices for pork belly sets, LA galbi, and side dishes with prices in Korean won](/images/articles/korean/korean_menu.webp)

Here's how each app performed:

<br>

| Google Translate | Photolate | Yandex Translate | Papago |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| ![Google Lens translation of a Korean menu showing English text overlaid on the original menu, with translations like "Pork ribs" and "Five layer bossam"](/images/articles/korean/google_korean_menu.webp) | ![Photolate result showing Korean menu translation with highlighted text detection and cultural background information about Korean dishes](/images/articles/korean/photo-translate_korean_menu.webp) | ![Yandex Translate menu translation showing English text overlaid on Korean menu with translations like "Adjacent" and "Pepper Jangjang"](/images/articles/korean/yandex_korean_menu.webp) | ![Papago translation interface showing Korean menu translated to English with terms like "Grilled pork belly meat" and "Red Chili Paste jigae"](/images/articles/korean/papago_korean_menu.webp) |

Let's compare how each app translated key menu items:

**Detailed Translation Comparison**

<br>

| 짜파게티 | Chapagetti | Jjapagetti | Tsapareri | Chapagetti |
| 신라면 | Shin Ramyun | Shin Ramyun | If it's God. | Shin Ramen |

**Google Translate**

It's like that reliable friend who's usually right - but sometimes takes things too literally.

Strong points:

- Translates common dishes accurately: "돼지갈비" to "Pork ribs"
- Handles measurements well: portion sizes and weights stay accurate
- Provides clear, natural English translations of basic menu items

Limitations:

- Often translates traditional Korean dishes too literally
- Missed cultural context in dishes like "오겹 보쌈" (translated as "Five layer bossam")

**Photolate**

Particularly strong with specialized Korean cuisine terms.

Strengths:

- Maintains authentic Korean dish names while providing clear translations
- Handles complex menu items well: "LA갈비 (1인분 280g) ->최상급 프라임등급" becomes "LA Galbi (1 serving 280g) Top-grade Prime"
- Preserves important menu details like portion sizes and grades

Weaknesses:

- Occasionally confuses similar ingredients: translated "오이스팸" (Cucumber Spam) as "Oyster Spam"
- Some seafood dish mistranslations like "꽁치찌개" (Saury stew) to "Mackerel Stew"

**Yandex Translate**

Shows significant inconsistency in Korean menu translation.

Major issues:

- Fails to translate many Korean dishes completely: "꽁치찌개" becomes just "/"
- Makes serious translation errors: "신라면" (Shin Ramyun) becomes "If it's God"
- Struggles with measurements: "280g" becomes "28°3"
- Often produces incomprehensible results for common menu items

**Papago**

Focuses on explanatory translations for non-Korean speakers.

Positive aspects:

- Translates Korean dishes into descriptive English: "오겹 글보쌈" becomes "Grilled pork belly meat"
- Uses clear, understandable terms for non-Korean speakers
- Accurately translates basic ingredients and dishes

Room for improvement:

- Creates awkward compound words like "Cucumberfam"
- Tends to lose traditional Korean culinary terms like "bossam" in favor of descriptions
- Occasionally produces unclear translations: "a tartness that never gets tired of" for a spicy dish

**Practical Recommendation**

For best results, combine Google Translate with Photolate.

Google Translate works well for basics, while Photolate provides:
- Accurate translation of traditional Korean dishes
- Cultural context about ingredients and cooking methods

Don't miss Photolate's "Background Info" section - it helps you understand what you're ordering.
